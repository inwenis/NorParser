1. don't -> this is one word, it should not be parsed as two words
2. what about numbers?
3. last names with a - -> those should probably not be separated
4. do new line characters indicate a sperated sentence? or only dots separate sentences?
	the specs only show examples when a dot is followed by a newline so it's not clear
5. the parser seems like a perfect candidate for property-based tests
6. should apostrophes at end of words stay?
	this dependes on what we are going to use the parsed output for
		if we use it to look up the words in a dictionary then apostrophes should be removed
		if we use it to understand the sentences the apostrophes should stay since they provide valuable information
