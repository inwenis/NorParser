1. don't -> this is one word, it should not be parsed as two words
2. what about numbers?
3. last names with a - -> those should probably not be separated
4. do new line characters indicate a sperated sentence? or only dots separate sentences?
	the specs only show examples when a dot is followed by a newline so it's not clear
5. the parser seems like a perfect candidate for property-based tests
